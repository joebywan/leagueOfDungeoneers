## Character Creator

**[Link here](./character_creator/character_creator.html)**

Pulled from [https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/263741/character-creation-tool](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/263741/character-creation-tool) originally, I've updated it to split the scripts, css out.  Working on updating it to dynamically update based on additional content added.  Have already done for races.  Means the ./character_creator/js/data.js can be updated with new content.

## Flowcharts

Considering the minimal info in the flowcharts in the book, plus the misprints, I'm working on mermaid versions of the flowcharts so I can update/add more.
